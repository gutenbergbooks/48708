<p class="caption2"><a id="Importance" name="Importance"></a>Importance of Den Hunting</p>

<p>There is perhaps no better method of keeping down the increase
of coyotes than to destroy the newly born whelps before they abandon
the dens to shift for themselves. A little time spent in locating dens
in April, May, and June and destroying the whelps will save months
of strenuous effort trying to rid the range of the predators after they
have reached maturity.</p>

<p>Coyotes are particularly destructive during the denning season because
of the need of extra food both for themselves and their young.
Lambing bands of sheep on open ranges suffer the heaviest losses.
Coyotes that kill lambs during April and May generally have dens,
and when the dens are located and the whelps destroyed, the sheep
killing usually stops. Some coyotes show great cunning in refraining
from killing lambs near their dens and will pass by a band of sheep
that is herded right over a den only to raid another several miles
distant. They have been known to carry leg of lamb a distance of 8
miles to their young in the den. Contrary to the belief of stockmen
and others, the male coyote is as destructive as the female, and special
attention to fresh kills at lambing time has shown that the tracks of
male coyotes are more in evidence than those of the females.</p>


<p class="caption2"><a id="Qualifications" name="Qualifications"></a>Qualifications and Equipment of the Den Hunter</p>

<p>The most essential qualifications of a den hunter are keen observation,
persistence, and familiarity with the habits of coyotes. He can
probably become more skilled in den hunting than in any other
phase of coyote control. The denning habits of coyotes are similar
in most sections, and the same general methods of den hunting can be
applied to humid mountainous sections and to semiarid deserts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Den sign&rdquo; means indications of denning activity and should always
be watched for. It may consist of tracks, a well-worn path leading
to and from a den, or holes freshly cleaned out. Holes made by the
coyotes in digging out squirrels or rabbits should not be confused,
however, with those prepared for dens. A good hunter will overlook
no likely place and should take advantage of every hint, for dens
are often found where least expected. He should look for den sign
in every locality where animals are frequently seen. He should keep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">« 3 »</a></span>
in mind the places used by pairs of coyotes and visit all old dens known,
as sign may often be discovered there at whelping time. Holes may
be cleaned out in one canyon and the den be just over the hill in
another. Sheep herders on a range usually can give valuable information
as to locations of dens.</p>

<p>The equipment of a den hunter should include at least two good,
gentle saddle horses, a small shovel, a pair of good field glasses, a
rifle of not less than .25 caliber, and a dog. Coyotes are not so much
afraid of a man on horseback as of one on foot. A rider, therefore,
can get many good shots, and in heavy sagebrush he can more easily
see and track coyotes from his vantage seat upon a horse.</p>


<p class="caption2"><a id="Breeding" name="Breeding"></a>Breeding Habits and Number of Young</p>

<p>In the mating season coyotes may be heard yelping much more than
usual, and packs of three to a dozen animals may be seen. Later the
breeding animals pair off. Some pairs may remain together for a
number of years, but as a rule coyotes do not mate for life.</p>

<p>The whelping season varies with latitude. In general, according to
studies of a large number of embryos by G. W. D. Hamlett, of the
Biological Survey, the season in the northern tier of States seems
somewhat earlier than farther south; in Montana, for example, breeding
begins about February 1 and lasts throughout the month, the average
date being February 15. In Texas, breeding seems to begin somewhat
later, although data are inadequate for definite conclusions. In some
States, as in Oregon and Arizona, Hamlett found a variation of at
least 2 months in the time of breeding, probably because of great
diversity in habitat. A study on the spot, with due attention to altitude
and other environmental factors, would probably explain any
unusual variation.</p>

<p>Coyote pups are born 60 to 63 days after breeding. Their eyes
open when they are 9 to 14 days old. The average number of young
to the litter is normally 7. Although there may be smaller litters when
food is scarce, it is not uncommon to find litters of 9 to 12 (<a href="#fig_1a">fig. 1, A</a>),
and some females have been known to have as many as 17 young.
The only thing provided in the nature of a nest is an enlarged section
of the den, and some dens do not have even this. The pups lie in the
dry dust on the floor.</p>

<p>Dens are often found to contain two litters, one consisting of
young with eyes not yet open and the other of pups about a month
old. One litter may be large and the other small, the latter probably
belonging to a young female that, apparently at a loss for a place to
den, had taken up quarters with her mother. Young females usually
whelp about 10 days to 2 weeks later than the older ones. An occasional
den may harbor three litters. At a den where two litters are
found there is usually only one male, which would suggest polygamy.</p>

<p>Under normal conditions a pair of coyotes is found with every den
unless one parent has been killed. If this happens to be the female
and the pups are young, they die. If they are old enough to eat meat,
the male parent cares for them, as he does his part in providing food.</p>


<p class="caption2"><a id="Denning" name="Denning"></a>Denning Sites and Habits</p>

<p>Coyotes do not select denning sites according to any recognizable
rule, but many of them return to the same general locality year after
year, even though dens are regularly dug out and the pups killed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">« 4 »</a></span>
den hunters. If the female is killed, the male may bring his new
mate to the same den the next season. A dug out den that has not
been badly damaged in removing coyotes may remain unoccupied for
two or three seasons and then be used again, as was the case with the
den in Conejos County, Colo., shown on the title page.</p>

</div>

<p>Dens may be found in a canyon, wash-out, or coulee, on a bank or
hillside (<a href="#fig_1b">fig. 1, B</a>), in a rock bluff, or even in level ground, as in a
wheatfield, stubblefield, or plowed field. They have been discovered
under deserted homestead shacks in the desert, under grain bins, in a
drainage pipe, under a railroad, in a hollow log, in a thicket, and under
a clump of thistles that had blown into a canyon.</p>

<p>As a rule, instead of digging all new dens, coyotes will enlarge abandoned
badger or rabbit holes or use deserted porcupine dens in rocky
promontories or canyon walls. Usually they start cleaning out the
holes several weeks prior to whelping. They generally claw out the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">« 5 »</a></span>
dirt in one direction from the mouth of the den, where it piles up into
a mound, although some dens have no such mound (<a href="#fig_2">fig. 2, A</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The female continues digging and cleaning out den holes, sometimes
a dozen or more, until the young are born. Then, if one den is disturbed
the family moves to another. Sometimes the animals move
only a few hundred yards, apparently just to have a cleaner home,
leaving many fleas behind. Occasionally a female that has lost her
whelps will clean out several holes
before becoming reconciled to her
loss. Barren females sometimes
clean out holes, but they are not
found traveling with a mate. Male
coyotes also work at many holes
in spring but generally to dig out
dead rabbits. The tracks of the
male will usually be seen at these
freshly dug holes, which have a
different appearance from those
cleaned out for dens, and dried-up
rabbit carcasses will generally be
found nearby.</p>

<p>When entering the den, the coyotes
almost always go around, not
over, the mound, if one is present.
Dens may have one or several entrances
in use, and several passages
may branch from the main one.
After the pups are born, small balls
of rolled fur and hair from the
mother&rsquo;s belly may be found in the
dry dirt in the mouth of the den.</p>

<p>Parent coyotes have no set time
for being at home and may be
found near the den at any hour.
Although they do most of their
killing early in the morning, they
sometimes visit the den only at
night. They are clean about their
dens; so there is little refuse or odor.</p>


<p class="caption2"><a id="Methods" name="Methods"></a>Methods of Den Hunting</p>

<p>The proper time for hunting coyote
dens is from April 5 to June 15.
If one starts too early, before some
of the coyotes have whelped, the
territory will have to be covered again. Where signs indicate a late
den, however, it should be sought in a follow-up visit.</p>

<p>The coyote den is usually made in rougher surroundings than are
dens of small burrowing rodents and is normally within reach of water.
Contrary to general supposition, however, coyotes do not always have
their dens near water. In hilly areas they usually do, but on the large
deserts of eastern Oregon the dens are often found as far as 6 miles
from water. Coyotes do not go to water regularly unless the weather
is warm, and pups do not need water until they are several months old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span></p>

<p>Den hunting should be systematic and thorough. Where the soil is
sandy the movements of coyotes can be readily ascertained by means
of tracks and other signs characteristic of the whelping season. The
general location of a den may occasionally be learned by hearing the
howling of the coyotes, but other means must be employed to actually
find it. It may be located by tracking, by watching the movements of
old coyotes, or by riding the range looking for holes, but systematic
tracking insures the best results.</p>

<p>A good time to hunt dens by tracking is just after a rain.
Another good time is the day after a severe windstorm, as storms
restrict the activity of the coyotes.</p>

<p>Water holes and springs in the desert are excellent places from
which to start in locating dens. It is best to circle the water hole,
noting the direction of the tracks and giving special attention to those
of pairs and to their relative freshness, for when fresh tracks of a
pair are noted they are generally close to the den. When sign is
found, it should be back-tracked to a point where there are tracks
going both ways; the tracks begin to form a trail within a quarter
of a mile from the dens. Near the den, unless the ground is too hard,
many tracks will be found going and coming in every direction.
Finding the den is then an easy matter. Sometimes, however, tracks
lead to a den from only one direction.</p>

<p>Loose hairs and distinctive tracks are often to be found in the
mouth of a used coyote den. The coyote track is elongated, and
not nearly so rounded as a dog track, and the coyote side-toe track is
longer than that of a dog of the same size. The tracks of young
coyotes, barren females, and those that have lost their pups can be
distinguished from those of denning pairs, as the latter generally
travel by a direct route, the tracks of the female usually being smaller
and more pointed than those of the male.</p>

<p>When the female leaves the den for water she almost always
travels on a direct line, probably not deviating over a hundred yards
from it in a distance of several miles. Coyotes do not always water
at the same place each time, however, nor return to their den direct
from the watering place unless the den is a long distance from water.
Sometimes the male will remain near the den while the female is
away, but more often the two travel together, the female holding a
little more to a true course than the male. The tracks often indicate
that they travel side by side for some distance, the male then wandering
away several hundred yards but later returning to his mate.</p>

<p>Coyotes with dens have regular hunting grounds to which they
usually travel on a nearly straight course, whether near or several
miles distant, but they do not travel back to the den on a direct line
again until after they have made their kills.</p>

<p>When the den is in danger of being discovered coyotes act in a
nervous manner. Some will circle about it at a distance when the
hunter is near; the old female may be seen in one direction and, after
disappearing, may later be seen peering over a hill in another quarter.
When a female with a den first sees a person, she looks first at him
for a moment, then almost invariably toward the den, sometimes
turning completely around to do so.</p>

<p>A den is usually located within a radius of approximately a mile
of freshly cleaned out holes. An experienced hunter can tell by the
appearance of a den and by signs nearby whether it is occupied,
without dismounting from his horse. When a den is located, if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">« 7 »</a></span>
whelps are roaming a considerable distance away, the searcher should
circle it, making plenty of noise to stimulate their return. They
should not be rushed, however, as they will then scatter and run
into any accessible hole, where extra effort in digging them out will
be required.</p>

<p>As a rule, one will not find many living rabbits near a den, so that in a
rabbit-infested district a scarcity of rabbits may be a clue to a nearby
den.</p>


<p class="caption2"><a id="Activities" name="Activities"></a>Activities of Whelps</p>

<p>Inexperienced hunters often dig out dens that contain no young.
If the searcher listens at the mouth of the den he can usually hear
any whelps inside, especially when they are quite young, as they are
then seldom quiet. If a nursing whelp loses hold of a teat, it is rather
noisy until it regains its hold.</p>

<p>The whelps emerge when about 3 weeks old, and then their tracks
and other sign are easily noted. At this age, they do not whine as
young pups do but can be heard moving around when in the den,
where, if crowded, they sometimes growl. Curiosity to see what is
going on outside will drive some to the entrance. When the burrow
is steep they are unable to clamber out at as early an age as when it
is nearly level. Little scratches made in their attempt to crawl out
will often be noted on the side walls and floor of the den.</p>

<p>When the whelps are about 8 to 10 weeks old the dens are abandoned
and the entire family roves about, remaining together until
early fall.</p>


<p class="caption2"><a id="Removing" name="Removing"></a>Removing Whelps from Dens</p>

<p>The digging necessary to capture pups depends largely on the
nature of the soil and the location of the den (<a href="#fig_2">fig. 2, B</a>). Some dens
are so shallow that little digging is required; others cannot be dug
out; and some burrows lead straight into a bank or under a hardpan
ledge. Much work can be avoided by running a shovel handle or
long stick as far as possible into the hole to ascertain its direction
and then digging a pit down to the den instead of following the burrow.
Where digging is extremely difficult, the animals may be disturbed
and induced to move, frequently to a den from which they
can be more readily taken. Usually they move from a quarter of a
mile to a mile away and can easily be tracked. If pups can be seen
back in a den but cannot be reached in digging, a forked stick or a
wire so twisted as to catch in their fur has been employed to save
labor; but if the den or burrow branches and turns, such an instrument
is never wholly satisfactory, as some of the whelps are likely to
be missed.</p>

<p>Before digging is begun, the den entrance should be blocked to
prevent the escape of the mother coyote, should she be inside the
den. When the pups are of suckling age she is often in the den with
them, but when they are old enough to play and be fed outside she
seldom goes into it. It is difficult to tell her whereabouts by her
tracks, as she backs out of the den unless disturbed and the tracks
all appear as if made in entering.</p>

<p>Pups are wobbly on their legs when only 2 or 3 weeks old, so that
if a pit 18 inches deep is dug just outside the mouth of the den they
fall into it when they attempt to crawl out and are easily captured.</p>

<p>Smoking the young out of the den is not satisfactory as a rule but
is sometimes successful. A good smoker can be made by soldering a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span>
half-inch hose coupling to the spout of a bellows-operated bee smoker
and using sulphur and pieces of burlap as fuel. A piece of garden
hose about 10 feet long can be attached and worked down into the
den close to the pups, preferably behind them. The operator should
stand back from the mouth of the den, armed with a good club to
dispatch the pups as they come out. Throwing a handful of calcium
cyanide into a den and stopping the hole with dirt is an effective
method of fumigation, but this chemical must be handled with
extreme care&mdash;as a rule by experienced workers only&mdash;as it is also
dangerous to man.</p>

<p>A small dog trained to go into dens and bring out the whelps is useful.
Such dogs are scarce, but with careful handling, the proper
breed (wire-haired fox terrier or other terrier) soon learns and enjoys
this work. Any dog, however, is a great help, as the parent coyotes
become much alarmed if it nears their den and often set up a howl or
series of barks and yelps, thus betraying the fact that a den is near.
A dog that runs rabbits and hunts several hundred yards from the
hunter is better than one that follows at the horse&rsquo;s heels. A small
dog is preferable. Coyotes are likely to give wide berth to a large
one, but will sometimes fight and chase a small dog, thus presenting a
good target for shots, particularly when they go some distance from
the den to fight the intruder. For several days after the den has been
destroyed females that have lost their whelps frequently fight or chase
any dog that comes near.</p>

<p>A 12-gage pump shotgun loaded with BB shot is good for hunting
pups that have left the dens but are still together. They may be
found lying under sagebrush or among the rocks and are more easily
hit with a shotgun than with a rifle when they start to scatter.</p>


<p class="caption2"><a id="Trapping" name="Trapping"></a>Trapping and Shooting Adults</p>

<p>A hunter should leave as few traces as possible of his visit to a den.
He should carry several traps, with which to try to capture the old
coyotes. It is well to set a few traps &ldquo;blind&rdquo;&mdash;that is, without bait
or scent&mdash;in the trails leading to the den, although some coyotes never
return to a den after a hunter has visited it. A good set can be made
by burying a dead whelp, leaving one foot exposed, and setting traps
nearby. Holes that have been cleaned out for dens make excellent
places for trap sets, particularly for catching females as they go in or
out before whelping. In such a situation, two traps should be set
blind, one on each side of the entrance or mound. Other favorable
sites are the beds where old coyotes lie, presumably on guard. These
beds may be close to the den or on a hillside or canyon rim half a mile
away. Directions for trapping coyotes are given in Department of
Agriculture Leaflet No. 59.</p>

<p>When coyotes are sighted near their dens they are usually quiet,
and some good shots may be possible. A hunter should never dismount
from his horse when a coyote stops to watch him, but should
wait until it starts moving and then dismount on some high spot and
be ready to shoot the instant it stops again. If it does not stop of its
own accord, a low whistle will often bait it long enough to offer the
hunter a good target.</p>
